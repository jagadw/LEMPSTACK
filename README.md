sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain
```
- Insert the configuration below:
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain www.your_domain;
    root /var/www/your_domain;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
```
- Create a link to the configuration file from sites-enabled directory:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
